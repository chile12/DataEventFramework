Windows: Virtuoso installstion

follow this guide: http://virtuoso.openlinksw.com/dataspace/doc/dav/wiki/Main/VOSUsageWindows
make sure to register the ODBC Drivers!

Now configurate the ODBC drivers with the Microsoft ODBC-Administrator:

or http://wikis.openlinksw.com/dataspace/owiki/wiki/VirtuosoWikiWeb/WinODBCtoVirt

note: This server requires a secure connection (SSL): This setting is not needed for 
connections to Virtuoso instances which are configured to demand SSL connections from 
clients; such demands are handled automatically by the driver. 

Problem 1: Setting up ODBC

My server is running Windows 2008 64bit. for now I have installed Virtuoso trial using the msi package available for download from OpenLink’s website. During installation it automatically sets up a System DSN:

There is a problem however. When I ran the test php script instead of graphs listed I got an error saying:

<code>[Microsoft][ODBC Driver Manager] The specified DSN contains an architecture mismatch between the Driver and Application</code>

Solution

To resolve this a DSN must be created using 32-bit version of obdcad32.exe, which sits in c:\windows\sysWOW64\. There is a problem however: installing 64-bit Virtuoso package does not install 32-bti driver. To get those you must install the Connectivity Souite available as a free download from OpenLink’s website.     ntvcz2zz.msi http://download.openlinksw.com/downwiz/final.vsp?pfam=2&pform=26&pcat=51&prod=virtuoso-connect-psnl&os=x86_64-generic-win-64&os2=x86_64-generic-win-64&xpfam=virtuoso&xpform=personal&xpcat=connect&xos=x86_64-generic-win-64&release-dbms=6.4-virt64

Then run odbcad32.exe to create a System DSN choosing OpenLink virtuoso driver. Now the php test script should work. Or should it?
